## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

This repository follows these conventions:
- **Class Names:** PascalCase (e.g., `Node`, `List`, `Stack`)
- **Function Names:** PascalCase (e.g., `Add()`, `Delete()`, `Show()`)
- **Variable Names:** PascalCase for class members, camelCase for locals
- **Comments:** Inline comments for complex logic
- **Indentation:** Tabs (as per project preference)

## 🔍 Key Implementations

### Linked List Operations
```cpp
class List {
    private:
        Node *First, *Last;
    public:
        void Add(int data);      // Add node at end
        void Delete(int data);   // Delete specific node
        void Show();             // Display list
        void AddBtwn(int num);   // Insert at position
};
```

### Stack Operations
```cpp
class Stack {
    private:
        Node *Top;
    public:
        void Push(int data);     // Add element
        int Pop();               // Remove element
        bool isEmpty();          // Check if empty
        void Display();          // Show stack
};
```
